# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

The assignment was to build a simple calendar appplication that allowed users to enter and save events for each hour slot of the work day. The time and date features were to utilize the Moment.JS libraries. In addition to the Moment.JS utilization, the application was to feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS elements. All application features have been implemented with a few additions. The theme will change after 6 PM to a dark theme mode. It will automatically revert back to light mode after midnight. The page will also auto-refresh after 1 minute to update the current date string's time.
